# ✅ AGENCY REPOSITIONING - QUICK SUMMARY FOR VOCALDICE

## What Was Done

Your website has been **completely repositioned from SaaS software to Done-For-You AI Automation Agency**. All critical changes are live and production-ready.

---

## The Problem (Before)

Your website was inadvertently positioned as **SaaS software**:
- ❌ "Deploy your AI agent" (self-serve language)
- ❌ "Dashboard" references (software UI terminology)
- ❌ "SoftwareApplication" schema (product classification)
- ❌ "Features" listed like a software product
- ❌ No mention that VocalDice does the work FOR you

**Impact:** Google and buyers confused VocalDice with software platforms like ChatGPT or Zendesk—not a full-service agency.

---

## The Solution (After)

Website now clearly positioned as **full-service AI automation agency**:
- ✅ "We design, build, deploy, and manage AI systems for you"
- ✅ Four mandatory "Done-For-You" agency positioning blocks added to main pages
- ✅ Changed to `ProfessionalService` schema (agency type)
- ✅ "Service capabilities" instead of "features"
- ✅ Every major page reinforces "VocalDice does the work, you focus on business"

1. Create "How We Deliver This" page explaining:
   - Discovery phase (understanding your needs)
   - Design phase (customizing AI behavior)
   - Deployment phase (integration & testing)
   - Optimization phase (ongoing management)

2. Add "Our Team" section showing:
   - AI architects

3. Expand case studies to explicitly state:
   - "Service Delivered: Custom AI Agent Design, Integration & Deployment by VocalDice"

4. Create "Engagement Model" page explaining retainer-based service delivery

These would further strengthen agency authority but are optional.
